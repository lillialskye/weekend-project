My idea for a weekend project
1. Create a website for amateur coin collectors. Allow them to enter coin type, mint mark, and year.  This would only be for pre-1964 coins and also silver bars.
	-I would need to check to see which mints were available for certain coins. Washington, and Standing Liberty quarters might have different mints.
	-I would use dollars(with possible inclusions to some Ikes), 50 cent pieces (Kennedy's have 2 different silver amounts and will be included), quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies, and bars
	-Dollars, halves, quarters and dimes- I would like to compute the value of these coins.  Even further I would like to see how much the user's coin collection was worth over time- like on a separate page
	-I want to use a carousel on the main page showing the main coin category with pictures. Possibly add coin log and coin worth  
	-Once clicking on Quarters a page generates with with pull down menu for Washington and Standing Liberty-Enter in year mint and amount and then hit update. Can also update coin amounts.
	-Coin log would allow you to see what coins that are in your collection.  
	-Coin worth would compute silver value of coins, See step 5.  Silver values would be based on previous Silver prices from close the night before
	-need to make a log in screen so user's coin information will be saved
	2. I need to get Red Coin guide
	
	
To Do 
1. Create Git Repository
2. Might have to change this code if it won't allow me to add form to it...<li><a href="#">Dollars</a></li>
3.Figure out how to use an image as a background. I like this one. http://www.bathroomreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Fotolia_73207034_Subscription_Monthly_M.jpg. But it dwarfs the menu and you can't see the text.  Too dark.
4. Figure out how to create a form for adding coins. 



Completed 
1. MAJOR GOAL completed I have the main menu horizontal and ready to be linked. It is at the top of the screen.  It includes dollars, halves, quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies, bars, my collection, what's it worth, and log in.  I forgot to add log in at first. When you click on bar block changes colors and so does text.  I've chosen a soft pallette, but will probabaly switch to an image later on.
2. Red book is ordered.
